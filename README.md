I am Abdullah Ali, a Computer Science major who has been programming and learning code for 2 years. I have had experience in Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I’ve gained some web development experience after taking a web programming course at WCC with Professor Steven Miller. He made us research different technologies and the advantages and disadvantages of others. My area of study was NEXT but we didn’t get farther than just research. Hopefully, this class will delve deeper into what I’ve already learned. I unfortunately have not collaborated on a project on GitHub, mostly because I feel like my coding ability isn’t where it needs to be yet. I also don’t know how to use GitHub on a professional level… only to install mods or find a repository for smart home linkage for my family’s smart home by using a Raspberry Pi and home assistant. I have made a website before, but the CSS was very basic. No animations, just color changes, buttons, search bars, and drop-down menus.

I definitely can see myself using this course later down the line. I have had so many people approach me asking if I can make a website for their business. What’s funny is I was an Engineering Major until my cousin described a website he wanted to build. With the little coding knowledge I had at the time, I could imagine how I would be able to do it and I decided to switch my major. I feel like being a full-stack web developer would be amazing. Knowing the backend while also perfecting how to make that stuff look pleasing to the average person's eyes sounds great to me. A website that I take inspiration from would probably be apple.com. The website is so simple but as you scroll more information starts spreading out in a clean informative way. Thinking about it, I should probably look into marketing so I can merge the two skills.
